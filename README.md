- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @doomsheep1
- ðŸ‘€ I started learning programming on my own about a year before university (2018) and continued on by enrolling in a business information systems bachelor.
  - Here's my list of programming knowledge that I have accrued:
    - Java (my first language)
    - HTML+CSS+Javascript
    - PHP
    - Variety of database languages like basic SQL (MySql), Hql (Hive in hadoop),
  Pig Latin (in hadoop), HBase (in hadoop), and Scala (Spark in hadoop)
    - Software development frameworks such as Agile (scrum to be exact)
    - Have an understanding of backend system administrations (Network administration, user administration, storage/filesystem administration, and basic shell scripting 
    (mainly bash)) 
    - Basic game development project pipeline
    - Understand and know how to use Unity Engine
    - C# 
- ðŸ‘€ Despite enrolling in a business information systems bachelor, my real interest is actually in game development which I picked up on my own while studying, 
I am specifically interested in the multiplayer-networking side of things but can work on game mechanics development as well.
I must say it was a really cool decision on my part as my bachelor really helped me start off and enforce understanding of the networking side of things as I developed a
multiplayer game together with a team (it was a huge self-directed school project).
- ðŸŒ± These are the things I wish to pick up or get better at:
  - How to better optimize games (in development) so that they run better (multi-threaded programming, performance coding techniques such as object pooling, the observer pattern)
  - The aesthetic side of game development (how to get better at 3d modelling, make levels look nicer in general, graphical optimizations, knowledge of how shadows/lighting work)
  - C++ and Unreal Engine
  - Network programming
